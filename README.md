# Thrust Map estimation

This repository holds all the tools and procedures used to estimate a Thrust Map using a thrust stand for offline data recording.

## Thrust Stand utils

The [thrust_stand](./thrust_stand/) folder contains the scripts used to carry out the experiments on the thrust stand so they can be replicated, as well as some test data obtained for a specific motor model and all the scripts used to fit and test the polynomial surface for the Thrust Map.
